            <h2>Risk & Return Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding the relationship between risk and return is fundamental to investment analysis. This page 
                explores how different hedge fund strategies position themselves along the risk-return spectrum and 
                evaluates their risk-adjusted performance using the Sharpe ratio. These visualizations help answer 
                critical questions about whether higher risk leads to higher returns and which strategies deliver the 
                best risk-adjusted performance.

                    This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between risk (annualized volatility) and return (annualized return) for individual hedge funds, colored by their investment strategy. Each point represents a fund, showing how different strategies position themselves along the risk-return spectrum.

                    Funds show a wide range of risk-return tradeoffs, with some strategies delivering higher returns without taking proportionally more risk. Strategies like Relative Value and Multi-Strategy tend to cluster toward more efficient outcomes.

                    There is only a weak relationship between fund size and Sharpe Ratio: Larger funds do not reliably deliver stronger performance. This suggests that scale alone does not determine risk-adjusted results.

                <p>
                    The Sharpe Ratio is calculated as: <strong>(Fund Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It measures how much excess return an investor receives for the extra volatility they endure by holding 
                    a risky asset. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. Generally:
