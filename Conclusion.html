            <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
            <p>
                Across strategies, we observe clear differences in risk, return, and overall efficiency. Relative Value and Multi-Strategy funds tend to deliver stronger risk-adjusted performance, while Macro and Equity Long/Short exhibit wider variability across metrics. Temporal patterns show that many strategies move together during certain market conditions, suggesting shared exposures to broader macro drivers.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also find only a weak relationship between fund size and performance, indicating that larger AUM does not guarantee better results. Taken together, the cross-metric comparisons highlight that no single strategy consistently outperforms on every dimension, reinforcing the importance of evaluating multiple factors and maintaining diversification across approaches.

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Strategy Performance Varies Significantly</h3>
                <p>
                    Different hedge fund strategies exhibit distinct risk-return profiles. Relative Value and Multi-Strategy approaches demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns, while Macro and Equity Long/Short strategies show greater performance dispersion.
                </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Market Conditions Drive Correlation</h3>
                <p>
                    Many strategies exhibit correlated performance during specific market periods, revealing shared exposures to broader macroeconomic factors. This suggests that diversification across strategies may be less effective during market stress periods.

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Size Does Not Guarantee Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    Our analysis reveals only a weak relationship between fund size (AUM) and risk-adjusted performance. Larger funds do not systematically outperform smaller ones, indicating that scale alone is not a reliable predictor of investment success.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Multi-Dimensional Evaluation is Essential</h3>
                <p>
                    No single strategy dominates across all performance metrics. Strengths in one dimension often come with tradeoffs in others, emphasizing the need for comprehensive evaluation across returns, volatility, and risk-adjusted measures.

                    Future extensions could incorporate longer time horizons, factor exposures (e.g., equity beta, rates, credit), and rolling-period metrics to better understand regime sensitivity. Additional interactivity—such as filtering by region or fund size—could help investors explore subsets of the universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With more detailed data, we could also examine persistence, survivorship bias, and whether top-performing strategies maintain their edge over time. These enhancements would provide deeper insights into the sustainability of strategy performance and help investors make more informed allocation decisions.

                <h3>Investment Strategy Recommendations</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on our analysis, investors should consider the following when constructing hedge fund portfolios:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Diversify Across Strategies</strong> - No single strategy excels in all market conditions; a balanced approach reduces concentration risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritize Risk-Adjusted Returns</strong> - Focus on Sharpe Ratios and other efficiency metrics rather than raw returns alone</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider Strategy Correlations</strong> - Be aware that strategies may converge during market stress, reducing diversification benefits</li>
                    <li><strong>Look Beyond Fund Size</strong> - Evaluate funds based on performance metrics rather than AUM as a proxy for quality</li>
                </ul>
