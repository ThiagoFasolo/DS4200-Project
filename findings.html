  <h1>Summary of Findings</h1>
  <p>
    Across strategies, we observe clear differences in risk, return, and overall efficiency. Relative Value and Multi-Strategy funds tend to deliver stronger risk-adjusted performance, while Macro and Equity Long/Short exhibit wider variability across metrics. Temporal patterns show that many strategies move together during certain market conditions, suggesting shared exposures to broader macro drivers. We also find only a weak relationship between fund size and performance, indicating that larger AUM does not guarantee better results. Taken together, the cross-metric comparisons highlight that no single strategy consistently outperforms on every dimension, reinforcing the importance of evaluating multiple factors and maintaining diversification across approaches.

  <h2>Future Work</h2>
  <p>
    Future extensions could incorporate longer time horizons, factor exposures (e.g., equity beta, rates, credit), and rolling-period metrics to better understand regime sensitivity. Additional interactivity—such as filtering by region or fund size—could help investors explore subsets of the universe. With more detailed data, we could also examine persistence, survivorship bias, and whether top-performing strategies maintain their edge over time.
