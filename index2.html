  <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Within this project, our team aims to provide an indepth analysis of hedge fund performance data. We aim to accomplisht this by examining the realtionships between risk, return, assets under management (AUM), investment startegies, and fund characteristics.

Through interactive visualizations and explanations, this website will walk through a step-by-step analysis that our team used. From data cleaning to final conclusion, we will answer key questions about hedge fund performance to provide potential investors with a risk-return profile that matches their needs.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Description</h2>
  <p>
    Our dataset contains approximately 8,000 hedge funds with monthly returns from September 2024 - September 2025. For each fund, we have attributes such as primary strategy, country, AUM, and derived metrics including annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown.

    We combined two proprietary industry datasets from:

    We used the fund performance dataset containing detailed return metrics, risk measures, and risk data, and the fund profile dataset containing fund metadata including manager information, investment strategies, and geographic locations.
