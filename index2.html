  <h1>Hedge Fund Strategy Performance Analysis</h1>
  <p>Group Members: Samuel Gioffre, Thiago Fasolo, Nichoals Sparrow</p>

  <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    <p>
  Hedge funds play a pivotal role in global financial markets by pursuing diverse investment strategies designed 
  to generate risk-adjusted returns independent of traditional benchmarks. Yet the industry’s limited transparency 
  makes it difficult for investors, regulators, and academics to compare performance across styles, regions, and time 
  horizons.
    </p>

    <p>
  Within this project, our team provides an in-depth analysis of hedge fund performance by examining relationships 
  between risk, return, assets under management (AUM), investment strategies, and key fund characteristics. Using a 
  proprietary dataset from With Intelligence, we explore patterns in volatility, cross-strategy correlations, style 
  persistence, and survivorship effects.
    </p>

    <p>
  Through interactive visualizations and clear explanations, this website walks through the full analytical process—from 
  data cleaning to final conclusions. Our goal is to make complex financial information more interpretable and to help 
  potential investors identify risk–return profiles that align with their needs, while also offering broader insights 
  into how alternative asset managers behave under different market conditions.
    </p>

  <h2>Data Description</h2>
  <p>
  We combined two proprietary industry datasets from:
  <a href="https://www.withintelligence.com" target="_blank">With Intelligence</a><br><br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Our dataset contains approximately 8,000 hedge funds with monthly returns from September 2024 - September 2025. 
    For each fund, we have attributes such as primary strategy, country, AUM, and derived metrics including annualized 
    return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown.
  </p>
  <p>
  We used the fund performance dataset containing detailed return metrics, risk measures, and risk data, 
  and the fund profile dataset containing fund metadata including manager information, investment strategies, 
  and geographic locations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our data cleaning process followed a structured workflow to ensure the final dataset was consistent, accurate, and 
    fully analysis-ready. We began by selecting only the essential profile and return columns, filtering each dataset
     to keep the fields actually present and prevent KeyErrors. After subsetting and copying these fields into clean 
     DataFrames, we performed an inner merge on Fund ID to retain only funds appearing in both sources with complete 
     core information. We then standardized data types by converting Inception Date to datetime, stripping percentage 
     signs and commas from all return-related fields, and converting them into numeric values. Fund ID was cast to a 
     string for consistency across joins, while descriptive fields such as fund name, structure, strategies, and 
     geographic information were stored as categorical variables to streamline filtering and improve efficiency. 
     Finally, we removed all rows containing missing values to ensure that only fully complete and reliable fund records 
     remained. This end-to-end process produced a clean, unified dataset suitable for accurate modeling, comparison, and 
     visualization.

    Hedge Fund Returns and Uncertainty — Timothy Krause
  </a>
</h4>
<p>
  This paper shows that hedge fund returns are strongly linked to market uncertainty using the VVIX index as 
  a proxy. Krause finds that funds most sensitive to VVIX outperform the least sensitive by roughly 5.97% 
  annually—informing our analysis of whether more volatile funds in our dataset similarly outperform less 
  volatile ones.

    Measuring Risk in the Hedge Fund Sector — Tobias Adrian
  </a>
</h4>
<p>
  This study highlights how hedge fund risk is driven by volatility and cross-fund covariances. Adrian’s 
  analysis of market conditions surrounding the 1998 LTCM crisis demonstrates that sector-wide co-movement 
  and volatility spikes are central to understanding systemic hedge fund risk.
